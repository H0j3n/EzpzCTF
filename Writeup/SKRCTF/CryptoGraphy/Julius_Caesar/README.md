# Cryptography

Challenge Name : Julius Caesar

# Solution

View the image will give us one image with something that almost looks like flag format which is SKR{flag_here}.

Write down the sentence somewhere
```code
FXE{Pnrfne_Pvcure_Qrpbqre}
```

Then Use this as alias or you can use CyberChef
```code
alias rot13="tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'"
```

Then we can get the flag by:
```code
echo "FXE{Pnrfne_Pvcure_Qrpbqre}" | rot13
```

# Flag
